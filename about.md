I'm very focused on creating relationships and generating movements.

Also I've involved in projects like the first NASA Space Apps Challenge in Mexico, Sketch or Die and other ones.

Currently working in Bridgefy, a mobile messaging app that keeps you connected over long distances without internet or phone data.
